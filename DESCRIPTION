Description: Microbiome intervention studies generate valuable data on  microbial ecosystem resilience, robustness, and stability. For this reason, they are ubiquitous in microbiome research; however, few rigorous data analysis approaches are available. In this study, we extend a classical transfer function approach to intervention analysis to the microbiome setting, drawing from advances in statistical learning and simultaneous inference. Our proposed methods enable the simulation of hypothetical intervention trajectories and False Discovery Rate-guaranteed selection of significantly perturbed taxa.
